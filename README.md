# Production ribbon

Chrome extension for showing a production ribbon when browsing through your production sites.
It's language agnostic, just mark all your production sites and the ribbon will appear on all of them.

The idea (as well as the css code) was taken from the Ruby gem [rack-dev-mark](https://github.com/dtaniwaki/rack-dev-mark), used for showing a ribbon when on dev or staging environments.
